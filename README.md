# CS210_InvestmentCalc_Program


Instructions
This project is object oriented, so you will need to add your functions as methods to the appropriate class for your project submission. Sense will only take your individual functions and not a class submission. 


Write a function to: 
 - calculate bank balances without a monthly deposit being made. Get feedback on how well my function works and tips on how to make it better.
 - calculate bank balances with a monthly deposit being made. 
 - format a table of values for display  based on which balance method was called. See the project documentation for details.
